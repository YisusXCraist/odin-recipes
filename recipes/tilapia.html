    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Step 1</b><br>
        Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 2</b><br>
        Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 3</b><br>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 4</b><br>
        Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 5</b><br>
        Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.
